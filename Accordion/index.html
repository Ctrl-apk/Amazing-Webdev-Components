            <div class="accordion-content">HTML and CSS are partners that work together to create web pages.
                And while they might be teammates, HTML and CSS visually look different, and they function
                differently too.
                So while you'll have to learn both, it's easy to learn HTML and CSS together at the same time. They
                ain't tough.</div>
